										Undoubtedly, it is Don’t put all your eggs in the same basket. It is very tempting to make all your investment in the same sector when their stocks are going up, but since market trends are very volatile, you are, at the same time, making yourself extremely vulnerable to lose all your money. Dealing with single sector investment requires razor sharp timing with zero margin for error - a tall order in such a speculative and volatile business. Hence, it is always advisable to make investments in different companies and in different sectors, so that you can achieve stable portfolio diversification and compensate losses in one sector against profits in another sector.

										<p>The physical markets for commodities deal in either cash or spot contract for ready delivery and payment within 11 days, or forward (not futures) contracts for delivery of goods and/or payment of price after 11 days. These contracts are essentially party to party contracts, and are fulfilled by the seller giving delivery of goods of a specified variety of a commodity as agreed to between the parties. Rarely are these contracts for the actual or physical delivery allowed to be settled otherwise than by issuing or giving deliveries. Such situations may arise when unforeseen and uncontrolled circumstances prevent the buyers and sellers from receiving or taking deliveries. The contracts may then be settled mutually.</p> 

										<p>Unlike the physical markets, futures markets trade in futures contracts which are primarily used for risk management (hedging) on commodity stocks or forward (physical market), purchases and sales. Futures contacts are mostly offset before their maturity and, therefore, scarcely end in deliveries. Speculators also use these futures contracts to benefit from changes in prices and are hardly interested in either taking or receiving deliveries of goods.</p>

										<p>The general theory goes that the higher the profit, the greater the risk. Since there is scope for high profit in the Stock Market, investing in the Stock Market can be risky. In fact, more than 80% of the people who put money in the market lose it and a majority of the rest are barely able to protect themselves from losses. Only a minuscule minority of investors are able to garner any substantive profits.</p>

										<p>The precept is very easy.</p>
										<p>Their investment, saving your investment is the first and most important part. This can be done by ensuring that you do not put your money in a company that does not show solid prospects. Fly- by- nights companies or companies whose shares touch the roof suddenly, need to be avoided. Companies that show a steady prospect are good to invest in. Needless to say, this process involves close acquaintance with market movements and a thorough understanding of the concepts involved. You should know when to dump your shares especially when they are becoming just junk papers.</p> 
										<p>The second thing is that adequate market knowledge is very important especially when you have invested in the stock market. One should be patient and judiciously responsive to market swings. Of course, luck is also a major factor.</p>

										<p>Basic human psychology. Men want profits- big and fast. Not many are deterred by the risks involved. The fact is that investment in the stock markets can give, potentially, the fastest ROI (Return On Investment), as the value of a stock can rise pretty fast, ensuring huge profit for investor. People buy shares in a company for either of two reasons:</p>

										<ul>
											<li><p>They have a stake in the company. They are concerned not only in the future growth in stock value but in the worth of the company itself. Their investments are long-term and they don’t sell their shares in an impulse. </p></li>
											<li><p>They want quick profit and don’t have any stake or interest in the company, but merely want some quick value addition. Most investors belong to this category. Their investments - both buying and selling - are impulsive. Mostly, they don’t do any market research and don’t follow any sector or company to gain proper knowledge before investing.</p></li>

										<p>A stock market is a market for the trading of publicly held company stock and associated financial instruments (including stock options, convertibles and stock index futures). Many years ago, worldwide, buyers and sellers were individual investors and businessmen. These days markets have generally become "institutionalized"; that is, buyers and sellers are largely institutions whether pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds or banks. This rise of the institutional investor has brought growing professionalism to all aspects of the markets. </p>

												<p>Investing in equities/shares offers many benefits over other asset classes like a high level of liquidity which unlike property, gives you ready access to your money. There are more than 5,000 companies listed on the exchange in which you can buy shares to match your investment needs. Other benefits include:</p>

												<p><strong>Returns:</strong> Equities can help you build long-term growth into your overall financial plan. Shares can produce significant capital gains through increase in share prices over longer term.  In addition, stocks pay dividend income and some companies even issue bonus shares to their share holders which are another way of passing on company profits.</p>

												<p><strong>Ownership:</strong> Stock represents share in ownership or equity stake in a company. If you are a stockholder, you own a proportionate share in the company’s assets. That means you gain part ownership of the company.</p>
																
												<p><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> Dividend income generated from shares is completely tax-free. Long-term capital gains arising on equity investment is not taxed by the government. That means, if you invest in a company and keep the shares for 12 months, you don’t need to pay any tax on income you earn on selling the shares after 12 months. Short term capital gains tax on shares is also just 15%, while investment in other asset classes attracts short-term capital gains tax of 30%.</p>

												<p><strong>Control over your financial future:</strong> You can choose to invest independently using your knowledge and expertise, share this responsibility with SHARE BUY SELL who can advise you on what shares to buy and sell or ask SHARE BUY SELL to manage portfolio for you.</p>

										<p> The term "Derivative" indicates that it has no independent value, i.e. its value is entirely "derived" from the value of the underlying asset. The underlying asset can be securities, commodities, bullion, currency, live stock or anything else. In other words, Derivative means a forward, future, option or any other hybrid contract of pre determined fixed duration, linked for the purpose of contract fulfillment to the value of a specified real or financial asset or to an index of securities. With Securities Laws (Second Amendment) Act,1999, Derivatives has been included in the definition of Securities. The term Derivative has been defined in Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, as:- A Derivative includes: - a security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan, whether secured or unsecured, risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security a contract which derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, of underlying securities.</p>

										<p>Futures Contract means a legally binding agreement to buy or sell the underlying security on a future date. Future contracts are the organized/standardized contracts in terms of quantity, quality (in case of commodities), delivery time and place for settlement on any date in future. The contract expires on a pre-specified date which is called the expiry date of the contract. On expiry, futures can be settled by delivery of the underlying asset or cash. Cash settlement enables the settlement of obligations arising out of the future/option contract in cash.

										<p>Options Contract is a type of Derivatives Contract which gives the buyer/holder of the contract the right (but not the obligation) to buy/sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price within or at end of a specified period. The buyer / holder of the option purchases the right from the seller/writer for a consideration which is called the premium. The seller/writer of an option is obligated to settle the option as per the terms of the contract when the buyer/holder exercises his right. The underlying asset could include securities, an index of prices of securities etc. Under Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act,1956 options on securities has been defined as "option in securities" means a contract for the purchase or sale of a right to buy or sell, or a right to buy and sell, securities in future, and includes a teji, a mandi, a teji mandi, a galli, a put, a call or a put and call in securities.</p>

As in the case of futures contracts, option contracts can also be settled by delivery of the underlying asset or cash. However, unlike futures cash settlement in option contract entails paying/receiving the difference between the strike price/exercise price and the price of the underlying asset either at the time of expiry of the contract or at the time of exercise / assignment of the option contract.

										<p>An initial public offering, or IPO, is the first sale of stock by a company to the public. A company can raise money by issuing either debt or equity. If the company has never issued equity to the public, it's known as an IPO.</p>

										<p>An IPO is also sometimes known as "going public." Technically, an IPO is the offering to sell but virtually all IPOs result in all the stock offered being sold. IPOs are generally managed by companies that specialize in handling IPOs and have experience in determining what the likely IPO offering price should be. If the IPO manager determines that the stock will not sell at an offering price that is acceptable to the company, the application for an IPO is usually withdrawn until a better time. As soon as all shares of an IPO have been sold, the stock is now tradable through stock exchanges or specialists that trade in the stock and the stock price may go up or down.</p>

										<p>A commodity futures contract is a tradable standardized contract, the terms of which are set in advance by the commodity exchange organizing trading in it.

										<p>The quality parameters of the “basis” and the permissible tender able varieties; the delivery months and schedules; the places of delivery, the “on” and ”off” allowances for the quality differences and the transport costs; the transport costs; the tradable lots; the modes of price quotes; the procedures for regular periodical (mostly daily) clearings; the payment of prescribed clearing and margin monies; the transaction, clearing and other fees; the arbitration, survey and other dispute redressing methods; the manner of settlement of outstanding transactions after the last trading day, the penalties for non-issuance or non-acceptance of deliveries, etc. are all predetermined by the rules and regulations of the commodity exchange.</p>
										<p>Consequently, the parties to the contract are required to negotiate only the quantity to be bought and sold and the price. Everything else is prescribed by the Exchange. Because of the standardized nature of the futures contract, it can be traded with ease at a moment’s notice.</p>

                                    <div class="panel-body">
										Step One - Identify your investment needs. 
										
										Your financial goals will vary, based on your age, lifestyle, financial independence, family commitments, level of income and expenses among many other factors. Therefore, the first step is to assess your needs. Begin by asking yourself these questions:
										a. What are my investment objectives and needs? Probable Answers: I need regular income or need to buy a home or finance a wedding or educate my children or a combination of all these needs.
										b. How much risk am I willing to take? Probable Answers: I can only take a minimum amount of risk or I am willing to accept the fact that my investment value may fluctuate or that there may be a short-term loss in order to achieve a long-term potential gain.
										c. What are my cash flow requirements? Probable Answers: I need a regular cash flow or I need a lump sum amount to meet a specific need after a certain period or I don't require a current cash flow but I want to build my assets for the future. By going through such an exercise, you will know what you want out of your investment and can set the foundation for a sound Mutual Fund investment strategy.

										Step Two - Choose the right Mutual Fund.

										Once you have a clear strategy in mind, you now have to choose which Mutual Fund and scheme you want to invest in. The offer document of the scheme tells you its objectives and provides supplementary details like the track record of other schemes managed by the same Fund Manager. Some factors to evaluate before choosing a particular Mutual Fund are:
										The track record of performance over the last few years in relation to the appropriate yardstick and similar funds in the same category.
										How well the Mutual Fund is organised to provide efficient, prompt and personalised service.
										Degree of transparency as reflected in frequency and quality of their communications.

										Step Three - Select the ideal mix of Schemes.

										Investing in just one Mutual Fund scheme may not meet all your investment needs. You may consider investing in a combination of schemes to achieve your specific goals. The charts could prove useful in selecting a combination of schemes that satisfy your needs.

										Step Four - Invest regularly

										For most of us, the approach that works best is to invest a fixed amount at specific intervals, say every month. By investing a fixed sum each month, you buy fewer units when the price is higher and more units when the price is low, thus bringing down your average cost per unit. This is called rupee cost averaging and is a disciplined investment strategy followed by investors all over the world. With many open-ended schemes offering systematic investment plans, this regular investing habit is made easy for you.

										Step Five - Keep your taxes in mind

										If you are in a high tax bracket and have utilised fully the exemptions under Section 80L of the Income Tax Act, investing in growth funds that do not pay dividends might be more tax efficient and improve your post-tax return. If you are in a low tax bracket and have not utilised fully the exemption available under Section 80L, selecting funds paying regular income could be more tax efficient. Further, there are other benefits available for investment in Mutual Funds under the provisions of the prevailing tax laws. You may therefore consult your tax advisor or Chartered Accountant for specific advice.

										Step Six - Start early

										If you are in a high tax bracket and have utilised fully the exemptions under Section 80L of the Income Tax Act, investing in growth funds that do not pay dividends might be more tax efficient and improve your post-tax return. If you are in a low tax bracket and have not utilised fully the exemption available under Section 80L, selecting funds paying regular income could be more tax efficient. Further, there are other benefits available for investment in Mutual Funds under the provisions of the prevailing tax laws. You may therefore consult your tax advisor or Chartered Accountant for specific advice. Step Six - Start early It is desirable to start investing early and stick to a regular investment plan. If you start now, you will make more than if you wait and invest later. The power of compounding lets you earn income on income and your money multiplies at a compounded rate of return. 


										Step Seven - The final step

										All you need to do now is to get in touch with a Mutual Fund or your agent/broker and start investing. Reap the rewards in the years to come. Mutual Funds are suitable for every kind of investor-whether starting a career or retiring, conservative or risk taking, growth oriented or income seeking.

										<p>Investing is a long-term process and one should not expect immediate returns for the product. The typical investment horizon for an investment in equity and equity linked products ranges from a minimum of 3 to 5 years. There are many reasons why you should stay invested for a longer time such as erratic market movements during shorter periods which can lead to equity markets giving negative returns, long business cycles, government and regulatory changes, global and local events, micro and macro events and to benefit of power of compounding etc. If you have an investment horizon below this then you should park your money in to safer asset classes such as debt schemes from mutual funds and Bank FDs</p>

					<p><strong>Returns:</strong> Equities can help you build long-term growth into your overall financial plan. Shares can produce significant capital gains through increase in share prices over longer term.  In addition, stocks pay dividend income and some companies even issue bonus shares to their share holders which are another way of passing on company profits.</p>

					<p><strong>Ownership:</strong> Stock represents share in ownership or equity stake in a company. If you are a stockholder, you own a proportionate share in the company’s assets. That means you gain part ownership of the company.</p>
																	
					<p><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> Dividend income generated from shares is completely tax-free. Long-term capital gains arising on equity investment is not taxed by the government. That means, if you invest in a company and keep the shares for 12 months, you don’t need to pay any tax on income you earn on selling the shares after 12 months. Short term capital gains tax on shares is also just 15%, while investment in other asset classes attracts short-term capital gains tax of 30%.</p>

					<p><strong>Control over your financial future:</strong> You can choose to invest independently using your knowledge and expertise, share this responsibility with SHARE BUY SELL who can advise you on what shares to buy and sell or ask SHARE BUY SELL to manage portfolio for you.</p></div>

					<p>Futures Contract means a legally binding agreement to buy or sell the underlying security on a future date. Future contracts are the organized/standardized contracts in terms of quantity, quality (in case of commodities), delivery time and place for settlement on any date in future. The contract expires on a pre-specified date which is called the expiry date of the contract. On expiry, futures can be settled by delivery of the underlying asset or cash. Cash settlement enables the settlement of obligations arising out of the future/option contract in cash. However so far delivery against future contracts have not been introduced and the future contract is settled by cash settlement only.</p>
